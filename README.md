in fall 2015, i'm attending [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io) and will be posting some of my work here. &lt;3


## "[generative text](/generative_text)", taught by allison parrish
a class about computational poetry
* _use the UNIX command-line text processing tools to do something creative with some source text. use a non-poem as input, and make a “poem” as output._
  i used different austrian election programs, and used "tr" to replace letters with whitespace, which resulted in different patterns of punctuation and numbers for each party.
